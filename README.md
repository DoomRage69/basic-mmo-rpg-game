How to Play
The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy by reducing its health to 0. You start the game with 100 health, and the enemy starts with 50 health.

Each turn, you can choose to attack the enemy or heal yourself. Attacking the enemy deals a random amount of damage between 0 and 20. Healing yourself restores a random amount of health between 0 and 20.

After you take your turn, the enemy will take its turn and attack you. The enemy's attack deals a random amount of damage between 0 and 10.

The game ends when either you or the enemy has 0 or less health.
